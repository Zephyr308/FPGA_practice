# FPGA Practice Repository

This repository contains multiple FPGA practice projects, exercises, and small IP cores. 
The goal is to demonstrate **clean, industry-ready RTL design practices**, including:

- Parameterized, reusable modules
- Testbenches with self-checking assertions
- Clear folder structure and documentation
- Scalable designs suitable for FPGA/ASIC workflows

## Projects

| Project Name                | Description                                         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| mini-bus-interconnect       | Parameterized N-to-1 bus interconnect example with multiple slaves and read/write support |
| <other-projects>            | TBD                                                 |

## Usage

Each project contains a `README.md` with instructions on simulation, synthesis, and testbench verification.
